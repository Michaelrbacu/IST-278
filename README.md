SQL Unit Assignments
This repository contains a collection of SQL unit assignments that I completed as a student. These assignments cover various topics and concepts in SQL, demonstrating my knowledge and skills in working with views, advanced queries, scripts, flow control, stored procedures, functions, and triggers.

Unit 1 - Views and Advanced Queries
This unit focuses on views and advanced query techniques. It explores creating views, using subqueries, working with complex joins, and optimizing query performance.

Unit 2 - Scripts and Flow Control
In this unit, the emphasis is on scripts and flow control in SQL. It covers writing scripts to automate tasks, using control statements like IF-ELSE and WHILE loops, and handling errors.

Unit 3 - Stored Procedures
The third unit concentrates on stored procedures. It delves into creating and executing stored procedures, passing parameters, and leveraging the benefits of modular code.

Unit 4 - Functions
Unit 4 is dedicated to functions. It explores the creation and usage of functions, understanding different types of functions (scalar, table-valued, etc.), and incorporating them into SQL queries.

Unit 5 - Triggers
The unit in this collection focuses on triggers. It covers the creation of triggers, their purpose in enforcing business rules, and their impact on database operations.
